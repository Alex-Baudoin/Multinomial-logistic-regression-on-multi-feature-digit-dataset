# Multinomial-logistic-regression-on-multi-feature-digit-dataset
We have 2000 images described by 6 sets of features (Fourier coefficients, correlation profile, Karhunen-Love coefficients, averaged pixel values, Zernike moments, morphology) and the goal is to use multinomial logistic regression to predict  handwritten digits on unseen data in R.
